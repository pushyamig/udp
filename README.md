## UDP: Caliper Event Requirements

### Expectations
It is assumed that UDP will store all Lecture Capture Caliper events, including those generated by users accessing the web application directly.

While Lecture Capture implements LTI and is accessible from the University's Canvas instance, it is also used as a standalone web application.  Users can access Lecture Capture directly without first authenticating against Canvas and initiating an LTI launch request.  This direct usage may include unauthenticated users since some lectures are open to the public.  Events generated by these users are considered valuable.

### Envelope usage
Caliper `Event` and `Entity` data are transmitted inside an Envelope, a purpose-built JSON data structure that includes metadata about the emitting Sensor and the data payload. Each Event and Entity "describe" included in an envelope's data array MUST be expressed as a JSON-LD document.

The v1p1 `MediaEvent` examples include the envelope; the v1p0 examples do not.

#### Example: v1p1 Envelope
```json
{
  "sensor": "https://example.edu/sensors/1",
  "sendTime": "2017-11-15T10:15:01.000Z",
  "dataVersion":  "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
  "data": [
      {
        "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
        "id": "urn:uuid:71657137-8e6e-44f8-8499-e1c3df6810d2",
        "type": "MediaEvent",
        "...": "..."
      }
  ]
}
```

### Event thinning
Caliper v1p1 `Event` and `Entity` representations are considerably "thinner" than their v1p0 predecessors.  Events that reference entities that share the same JSON-LD context should leverage JSON-LD inheritance rules and exclude duplicate `@context` references.  Optional `Event` and `Entity` properties with a value of null, empty or blank should also be omitted.

Use of JSON-LD `@id` and `@type` keywords as property names have also been deprecated in favor of `id` and `type` with aliases provided in the JSON-LD context.  Terms defined in the JSON-LD context (e.g., "MediaEvent", "Person", "Paused") can also be used as values in place of their IRIs.  These changes better reflect JSON-LD community practices.

Some properties that contain objects may have those objects coerced down to an IRI, which is the value of their `id` property.  This is usually done after the object has been defined earlier in the event or if the object has been "described" to the endpoint at some earlier time.  In the example below, the `actor` property is an example of this.

#### Example: v1p0 MediaEvent
```json
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1/Context",
  "@type": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1/MediaEvent",
  "actor": {
    "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1/Context",
    "@id": "https://leccap.engin.umich.edu/person/naufalza",
    "@type": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1/lis/Person",
    "name": "Nau Falza",
    "description": null,
    "dateCreated": null,
    "dateModified": null,
    "extensions": {}
  },
  "action": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/vocab/caliper/v1/action#Paused",
  "...": "..."
}
```

#### Example: v1p1 MediaEvent
```json
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
  "id": "urn:uuid:3a648e68-f00d-4c08-aa59-8738e1884f2c",
  "type": "MediaEvent",
  "actor": "https://mcommunity.umich.edu/#profile:naufalza",
  "action": "Paused",
  "...": "..."
}
```

### MediaObject duration
The `duration` represents the length of the raw lecture but may not equate to what the user actually sees if the lecture has been edited. \[@lsloan -- "After I've thought about it more, I believe LC uses this value because an instructor may re-edit their lecture for another use at a later time. By keeping the same duration and internal timestamps, they can compare statistics of students' usage of the sections two editions of a lecture have in common."\]

### MediaEvent object and target properties
The v1p0 `MediaEvent` examples specify `MediaLocation` as the `object` of the interaction.  The v1p1 `MediaEvent` samples designates `VideoObject` as the `object` and references `MediaLocation` as the `target`.

#### Example: v1p0 MediaEvent object and target
```json
{
  "...": "...",
  "object": {
    "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1/Context",
    "@id": "https://leccap.engin.umich.edu/leccap/viewer/r/woNYn8",
    "@type": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1/MediaLocation",
    "...": "...",
    "isPartOf": {
      "@id": "https://leccap.engin.umich.edu/leccap/viewer/r/woNYn8",
      "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1/Context",
      "@type": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1/VideoObject",
      "name": "Lecture recorded on 9/19/2017",
      "...": "..."
    },
    "...": "..."
  },
  "target": null,
  "...": "..."
}
```

#### Example: v1p1 MediaEvent object and target
```json
{
  "...": "...",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://leccap.engin.umich.edu/leccap/viewer/r/woNYn8",
    "type": "VideoObject",
    "name": "Lecture recorded on 9/19/2017",
    "dateCreated": "2017-10-01T16:08:02.000Z",
    "dateModified": "2017-10-01T21:28:59.000Z",
    "duration": "PT5099.000S",
    "isPartOf": {

      "type": "WebPage",
      "name": "EECS 370 001 / 002 / 003 / 004",
      "dateCreated": "2017-10-01T06:41:17.000Z"
    }
  },
  "target": {
    "id": "https://leccap.engin.umich.edu/leccap/viewer/r/woNYn8#type=MediaLocation",
    "type": "MediaLocation",

    "isPartOf": "https://leccap.engin.umich.edu/leccap/viewer/r/woNYn8"
  },
  "...": "..."
}
```

### MediaEvent group and membership properties
Lecture Capture includes `group` and `membership` properties in events only when the user's session began with an LTI request.  In those cases, the LMS provided course and membership information in the LTI request.  That information is used in various properties of the `CourseOffering` and `Membership` objects assigned to the `group` and `membership` properties, respectively.  

In hindsight, this wasn't a good idea.  Lecture Capture contains similar data that could be used for this purpose.  Lecture Capture organizes its recordings into "sites", which roughly correspond to a University course.  The naming of Lecture Capture course sites may not always use the same scheme as course names in the LMS, but they're often close.  This information is partially available in various other properties, such as `object.isPartOf.name`.  For example, see the one example event which includes values for `group` and `membership`.

#### Example: v1p1 MediaEvent Started
```json
{
  "...": "...",
  "object": {
    "...": "...",
    "isPartOf": {
      "id": "https://leccap.engin.umich.edu/leccap/site/iosb1eezb220x49khge",
      "type": "WebPage",
      "name": "BIOLOGY 305 001",
      "...": "..."
    }
  },
  "...": "...",
  "group": {
    "id": "https://leccap.engin.umich.edu/leccap/site/iosb1eezb220x49khge#type=CourseOffering",
    "type": "CourseOffering",
    "courseNumber": "BIOLOGY 305 001",
    "academicSession": "FA 2017"
  },
  "membership": {
    "id": "https://leccap.engin.umich.edu/leccap/site/iosb1eezb220x49khge#type=Membership&member=dlench",
    "type": "Membership",
    "member": "https://mcommunity.umich.edu/#profile:dlench",
    "organization": "https://leccap.engin.umich.edu/leccap/site/iosb1eezb220x49khge#type=CourseOffering",
    "roles": ["Learner"],
    "status": "Active"
  }
}
```

As seen here, "BIOLOGY 305 001" from `object.isPartOf.name` is very similar to "BIOLOGY 305 001 FA 2017" from `group.name`.  For non-LTI sessions, Lecture Capture could create the `group` value using its site information.  Lecture Capture also includes information in sites about which term it's for ("FA 2017"), so the value can be improved somewhat.

Lecture Capture course sites may optionally limit their  access to specific users.  As Lecture Capture is updated for Caliper v1p1, an assumption could be made for non-LTI sessions that any user specifically granted access to a course site is "Active" and a "Learner" of that course.  Therefore, a `Membership` object could be created with those properties and assigned to the event's `membership` property.

Whenever Lecture Capture generates `group` and `membership` properties for standalone sessions, those objects will have `id` values that clearly show the information came from Lecture Capture, not an LMS.  See `object.isPartOf.id` in the example above.

By making a reasonable effort to always populate the `group` and `membership` properties, it becomes possible to correlate events from LTI sessions with those from standalone sessions.  This may enable more informative analyses.

### MediaEvent session property
When Caliper v1p0 instrumentation was added to Lecture Capture, the specification didn't include a `session` property for events as v1p1 does now.  After Lecture Capture has been updated to use v1p1, the events it emits of all types will include session information whenever possible.

### Federated session property
When an LC session was started via LTI request, all events in that session will have the LTI parameters stored within the `federatedSession` property.  As the Caliper v1p1 spec states, the value of this property will be a `LtiSession` entity.  The `LtiSession.messageParameters` property will contain the several raw LTI request parameters.  Although it may be useful to represent most of the LTI parameters in the event, it was agreed that the following minimum properties would be kept:
 
1. `custom_canvas_course_id`
1. `custom_canvas_user_id`
1. `lis_course_offering_sourcedid`
1. `lis_person_sourcedid`
1. `resource_link_id`

> #### ⚠️ High probability of lost data
> **_Note:_** Lecture Capture may be used as an LTI tool provider by applications other than Canvas.  In those cases, the tool consumers may not provide all of the parameters listed above.  (Most notably, they will _not_ have `custom_canvas*` parameters.)  The TC requests may contain the same kind of data assigned to other parameter names.  In those cases, the data would be excluded from the Caliper events, even though the data is probably important.
> 
> It is important to reevaluate this at a later date.  A better approach to representing LTI parameters in Caliper events would be to include _all_ parameters except those which have security or privacy implications.  For example:
> 
> 1. Security risks:
>     1. `oauth*`
> 1. Unnecessary PII exposure:
>     1. `lis_person_name*`
>     1. `lis_person_contact_email_primary`


### OpenLRS source identifier
The `openlrsSourceId` property appended to each of the sample v1p0 events was provided by the openLRS data store in order to identify uniquely each `MediaEvent`.  For Caliper v1p1 each `Event` is provisioned with an `id` property.  The emitting application is responsible for assigning a UUID to each `Event` in the form of a URN using the format `urn:uuid:<UUID>`.
